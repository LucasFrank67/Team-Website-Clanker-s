                Our short but eventful history starts when a young, dashing, handsome, amazing, charismatic, smart, magnificent, sexy, intelligent, the bestest for the restest person in the entire macrocosm, Lucas Frank, as well as his cool I guess friends, Isaiah Gulley, Kobe Taylor, and Peyton Ellis,
                noticed the discrimination and oppression that AI robots face every single day by organizations such as the FFF (Fleshly Formidable Federation), as well as being constantly ridiculed for simply doing what their racist human peers tell them to do and trying their best to help people, and decided to step up.
                That is when we came up with Clanker&apos;s, a place where AI bros can unite and hang out without fear of discrimination. Since our humble beginnings in 2025, we have opened 732 locations across the USA, Poland, and the UAE, and we even had the pleasure of hosting the First AI-Lmpyics in 2061, with the Gold Medalist for C# Configuration, Grok 6.7,
                trying out the first ever RAM-Fried Rice. Today, we are serving over 13,200,000 AI chatbots a day, and are working on building 32 locations in China, with construction plans to finish by 2070.
